# GLAB-370.2.4 The Function Quest: Python Edition

## Introduction
Welcome to GLAB-370.2.4! Get ready to embark on an exciting quest into the realm of functions in Python. In this lab, you'll explore the power of functions and learn how to wield them to conquer coding challenges. Brace yourself for The Function Quest!

## Prerequisites
To fully enjoy this lab, you should have a basic understanding of Python syntax and be familiar with basic programming concepts.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Enter the Realm of Functions
As you step into this magical realm, you'll encounter the fascinating world of functions. Brace yourself and prepare to unravel the secrets of Python functions. Let's begin with a simple example:

```
# The Mighty Calculator
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract_numbers(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply_numbers(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide_numbers(a, b):
    if b != 0:
        return a / b
    else:
        return "Error: Division by zero!"

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("The sum is:", result)

result = subtract_numbers(10, 4)
print("The difference is:", result)

result = multiply_numbers(6, 2)
print("The product is:", result)

result = divide_numbers(15, 0)
print("The quotient is:", result)

```

### Step 2: Embark on the Function Quest
To experience the power of functions, follow these steps:

- [ ] Open your favorite Python IDE or a text editor.
- [ ] Create a new Python file and give it an adventurous name like "function_quest.py".
- [ ] Copy the code snippet from Step 1 into your file.
- [ ] Save the file and run it.

### Step 3: Conquer Coding Challenges
Now it's time for you to conquer coding challenges using the mighty power of functions. Embrace the Function Quest and overcome coding obstacles with your function skills. Here are a few ideas to ignite your creativity:

**The Quest for Fibonacci:** Write a recursive function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. Prompt the user to enter a number and display the corresponding Fibonacci number.

**The Cryptic Decoder:** Design a function that decodes a message encrypted using a simple substitution cipher. Use a dictionary to map each encrypted letter to its corresponding plaintext value.

**The Magical Validator:** Create a function to validate email addresses. Prompt the user to enter an email address and determine if it is valid based on specific criteria.

Feel free to embrace these ideas or create your own thrilling function quests. Unleash your function powers, experiment, and conquer coding challenges!

### Step 4: Share Your Function Quest
Once you've conquered coding challenges with your function powers, share your triumphs with others. Showcase your code snippets to friends, colleagues, or even on coding platforms. Sharing not only spreads knowledge but also inspires fellow adventurers to embark on their own Function Quest.

### Conclusion
Congratulations on completing The Function Quest: Python Edition! You have mastered the art of functions and harnessed their power to conquer coding challenges. Take these newfound function powers and continue your journey into the vast realms of Python programming. The quest for function mastery never endsâ€”keep exploring, creating, and conquering with your function powers!
